# big-data
This project leverages Apache Spark to analyze transactional data from an online
retail store, aiming to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior and enable
data-driven marketing strategies. Using a dataset of 541,909 transactions from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository, we implemented a scalable machine learning workflow to
segment customers based on their purchasing patterns (Recency, Frequency, and
Monetary Value).
